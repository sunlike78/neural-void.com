# Foldwink

**Version 0.8.2 - release-candidate web/PWA, by Neural Void.**

Foldwink is a short daily grouping puzzle. Find four hidden groups of four in a
4x4 grid. A correct group locks in; four mistakes end the round.

Medium puzzles use the Foldwink Tabs: every solved group reveals one more
letter on each unsolved tab. Once per medium puzzle, the player may Wink one
tab to reveal its full category. Easy puzzles intentionally have neither Tabs
nor Wink; Hard reveals Tabs more slowly and has no Wink.

## Product status

- Mobile-first static web/PWA. Direct web is the canonical product; itch.io is
  optional discovery.
- Tactile 2.5D card surface, nine local paper/card/wood/tile audio cues, and
  a canvas share card.
- Local-first: no accounts, backend, cloud sync, or leaderboard.
- Active curated pools: EN 500 (275 easy, 191 medium, 34 hard), RU 500,
  DE 500.
- Optional Ko-fi and cosmetic Supporter checkout are code-ready but hidden
  until valid public URLs are configured. No core gameplay is paywalled.
- Public free launch is pending canonical deploy and physical device QA.
  Public paid launch additionally requires real checkout-return verification.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints, normally `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

Foldwink is a static Vite application. `npm run build` writes `dist/`.
Deploy that directory to the canonical direct web/PWA origin first.

For a free deployment, no environment values are required. For optional paid
surfaces, configure public values outside source control:

- `VITE_KOFI_HANDLE`
- `VITE_SUPPORTER_CHECKOUT_URL`
- `FOLDWINK_CANONICAL_URL` for the paid preflight command only

Read [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) and
[docs/MONETIZATION.md](docs/MONETIZATION.md) before publishing. Do not activate
payment CTAs until the deployed checkout return has been tested on the same
origin.

## Content work

Puzzle JSON is bundled at build time. Add or change a puzzle only through the
editorial workflow:

1. Create or revise a draft outside the active pool.
2. Run the draft/reference validator against the active pool.
3. Require editorial review for naturalness, ambiguity, and language quality.
4. Promote one-for-one, archive the retired board, then run the full gates.

The validator catches structural errors and defined duplicate risks; it cannot
replace human editorial judgment. See
[docs/content/PUZZLE_EDITORIAL_GUIDELINES.md](docs/content/PUZZLE_EDITORIAL_GUIDELINES.md).

## Product boundaries

Foldwink deliberately does not include accounts, cloud sync, multiplayer,
runtime-generated puzzles, paid gameplay advantages, autoplay ads,
interstitials, banners, a 3D renderer, or a motion framework.
