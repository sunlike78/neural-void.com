# Walkthrough — Foldwink "100% Gold" Wow-Effect Polish

This walkthrough covers the final layer of "wow-effect" polish added to the Foldwink MVP. These additions focus on tactile feel, visual payoff, and micro-interactions using only pure React/CSS.

## 🎨 Major Polish Features Implemented

### 1. Magnetic 3D Parallax Tilt (Desktop Haptics)
- **Feature**: Cards physically tilt and "look" at the user's cursor on hover. 
- **Implementation**: We calculate normalized mouse coordinates (-1 to 1) in `Card.tsx` on `onMouseMove`. These values are piped directly into an inline CSS `transform: perspective(600px) rotateX(...) rotateY(...)`.
- **Result**: Highly tactile cards that react realistically without any heavy JS animation libraries.

### 2. Organization of Chaos (FLIP Grid Shift)
- **Feature**: When a group of 4 cards is solved, they smoothly fly out of the grid and collapse into the top row, pushing the unsolved cards down.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Modified `applyCorrectGroup` in `src/game/engine/progress.ts` to actually reorder `game.order`.
  - Implemented a pure, custom `useLayoutEffect` FLIP animation inside `Grid.tsx`. It tracks child DOM rects via `data-key` and uses hardware-accelerated CSS `transform: translate` for a bouncy spring transition.
- **Result**: The chaotic layout physically organizing itself into a clean row delivers a massive dopamine hit.

### 3. Magical Wink Sparkles (Micro-Burst)
- **Feature**: Triggering the "Wink" (reveal) joker on a tab emits a subtle, lightweight particle burst.
- **Implementation**: Added a `<WinkSparkles />` component (`WinkSparkles.tsx`) using a zero-dependency HTML5 `<canvas>`. It spawns 30 gold/white particles with gravity and alpha fade, clipped exactly inside the winked tab.
- **Result**: Using the only "joker" in the game feels magical and deliberate.

### 4. 12-Second Suno Win Melody (Audio Fix)
- **Feature**: The victory sound now plays the full, intended 12-second Suno marimba melody.
- **Implementation**: The original `build-sound-pack.mjs` was brutally truncating the 2-minute Suno source file to just 2.4 seconds (`maxDurationMs: 2400`), resulting in a generic blip. Increased the capture window to 12s, updated `cues.test.ts` to allow a 2MB asset size limit, and rebuilt the sound pack.
- **Result**: The player is rewarded with a beautiful, uninterrupted acoustic victory fanfare.

### 5. Card Initial Deal Stagger
- **Feature**: Cards physically cascade onto the table when the puzzle loads.
- **Implementation**: Pure CSS `@keyframes fw-deal` applied with dynamically staggered `animation-delay` based on `index`.

### 6. Organic Sound Pitch Variance
- **Feature**: Clicking cards sounds like real physical tiles.
- **Implementation**: We multiply the base playback rate of `select` and `deselect` sounds by a random factor `(0.98 to 1.02)` via Web Audio API, making every click uniquely textured.

### 7. Premium Noise Texture
- **Feature**: The background has a subtle physical paper grain.
- **Implementation**: A fixed SVG `feTurbulence` overlay with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` at `0.04` opacity.

### 8. One-Away Tension Vignette
- **Feature**: When submitting 3/4 correct, the screen border subtly pulses red.
- **Implementation**: A lightweight `z-[100]` radial gradient overlay added in `GameScreen` triggered by `flash === "one-away"`.

### 9. A11y Focus Rings
- **Feature**: Full keyboard navigation accessibility.
- **Implementation**: Added `focus-visible:ring-2` to all interactive components (Cards, Tabs, Buttons, Toggles).
