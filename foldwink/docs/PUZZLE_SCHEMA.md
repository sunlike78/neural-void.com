# Puzzle Schema

## Canonical TypeScript shape

```ts
type PuzzleDifficulty = "easy" | "medium" | "hard";

type PuzzleGroup = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  items: [string, string, string, string];
  /**
   * Short keyword used by Foldwink Tabs on medium and hard puzzles. Medium
   * reveals one more letter per solve and supports one Wink; Hard reveals
   * more slowly and has no Wink.
   */
  revealHint?: string;
};

type Puzzle = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  difficulty: PuzzleDifficulty;
  groups: [PuzzleGroup, PuzzleGroup, PuzzleGroup, PuzzleGroup];
  editorialSummary?: string;
};
```

## JSON example (easy, no twist)

```json
{
  "id": "puzzle-0001",
  "title": "Starter Pack",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "groups": [
    { "id": "planets", "label": "Planets", "items": ["Mars", "Venus", "Earth", "Jupiter"] },
    { "id": "colors", "label": "Colors", "items": ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow"] },
    { "id": "pets", "label": "Pets", "items": ["Dog", "Cat", "Hamster", "Rabbit"] },
    { "id": "sports", "label": "Sports", "items": ["Tennis", "Boxing", "Football", "Golf"] }
  ]
}
```

## JSON example (medium with Foldwink Tabs)

```json
{
  "id": "puzzle-0019",
  "title": "Red shades",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "editorialSummary": "Four categories that all plausibly contain the word 'red' but only one actually names reds.",
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "reds",
      "label": "Shades of red",
      "revealHint": "Reds",
      "items": ["Scarlet", "Crimson", "Ruby", "Cherry"]
    },
    {
      "id": "fruits",
      "label": "Red fruits",
      "revealHint": "Fruits",
      "items": ["Apple", "Strawberry", "Pomegranate", "Raspberry"]
    },
    {
      "id": "birds",
      "label": "Red birds",
      "revealHint": "Birds",
      "items": ["Cardinal", "Robin", "Flamingo", "Macaw"]
    },
    {
      "id": "signals",
      "label": "Stop signals",
      "revealHint": "Signals",
      "items": ["Brake", "Siren", "Alarm", "Flag"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The game renders these four hints across the Foldwink Tabs row above the grid. At stage 0 the player sees `R···` / `F·····` / `B····` / `S······`. Each correct solve reveals one more letter on every remaining tab. When a group is solved, its tab snaps to the full category `label` in its solved color.

### Wink mechanic

Once per **medium** puzzle the player may tap an unsolved tab to **Wink** it. That tab's full category label appears immediately, regardless of progressive reveal stage. Only one tab can be winked per game. The winked tab is not solved: the player still has to find its four matching items.

Hard puzzles also use the Foldwink Tabs row, but with the slower hard reveal formula: the first solve retains the one-letter state and later solves add letters. Hard puzzles have no Wink.

## Validation rules (enforced by `npm run validate`)

Hard (error):

- exactly 4 groups
- each group has exactly 4 items
- every puzzle has a unique `id` across the pool
- every group has a unique `id` within the puzzle
- items must be non-empty strings
- labels must be non-empty strings
- no duplicate items across groups within a single puzzle (case-insensitive)
- difficulty must be `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`
- if a `revealHint` is present, it must be a non-empty string

Soft (warning):

- item length outside `[2, 22]` characters
- same item string appearing in multiple puzzles (cross-puzzle reuse — often intentional)

## Fairness checklist per puzzle

1. Is there one intended canonical solution?
2. Does any item naturally belong to more than one group?
3. Are the category labels real and defensible?
4. Are any items so obscure that they make the puzzle feel unfair?
5. Is the false trail interesting rather than trick-only?
6. For medium and hard puzzles: is every available `revealHint` short enough to fit a tab (about 10 characters or fewer) and a meaningful category keyword? Medium Wink reveals the full category label, not the hint.
7. For hard puzzles: does the board remain fair with the slower Tabs reveal and no Wink?
