## 1. What Was Done

### Phase 1 — UX / Front-End Fixes

| Fix                                        | Severity           | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onboarding overflow on 320px viewport      | HIGH               | Added `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto` to modal inner container. "Got it" button now reachable on all viewports.                                                             |
| Wink indicator shown on Hard mode          | HIGH (found by QA) | `FoldwinkTabs` showed "wink ready" on Hard puzzles where Wink is disabled. Fixed: `winkAvailable` now checks `puzzle.difficulty === "medium"`. Wink chip hidden entirely on Hard/Easy. |
| Lint errors in `scripts/human-like-qa.mjs` | MEDIUM             | 24 ESLint errors from Node/browser globals not declared in config. Extended scripts eslint config to cover `.mjs` and `.js` files with proper globals.                                 |
| Header title overflow                      | LOW                | Added `min-w-0` + `truncate` safety on title text. Prevents long titles from pushing right-side controls off-screen on narrow viewports.                                               |
| Menu button container width                | LOW                | Changed `w-60` to `w-full max-w-60` for slightly better narrow viewport behavior.                                                                                                      |

### Phase 2 — Browser QA Hardening

| Improvement            | Detail                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extended QA automation | Added 3 new test functions: `runMediumQA`, `runHardQA`, `runMobileMediumQA`                             |
| Seeded state testing   | Created `SEEDED_STATS` and `SEEDED_PROGRESS` to unlock Medium and Hard without playing through 5+ games |
| Medium flow coverage   | Foldwink Tabs visible, Wink indicator present, result screen reached, share button tested               |
| Hard flow coverage     | Master Challenge button enabled, Tabs visible, Wink correctly absent                                    |
| Mobile medium coverage | Tabs visible, no horizontal overflow                                                                    |
| Screenshot count       | 15 → **25** screenshots (10 new covering Medium, Hard, and mobile Medium)                               |
| Finding count          | 12 → **20** findings, **0 critical/high** (down from 1 high)                                            |
| Console errors         | **0** across all viewports and modes                                                                    |

### Phase 3-4 — Share Card + Sound Readiness

| Item                           | Status                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Sound preview tool             | `scripts/preview-sounds.html` exists with all 9 cues                                                                  |
| iOS Safari AudioContext resume | Fix confirmed in code and prior manual session                                                                        |
| Sound mute persistence         | Confirmed working in automation                                                                                       |
| Share card visual quality      | **Unverified** — requires human eye                                                                                   |
| Sound quality                  | **Unverified** — requires human ear                                                                                   |

### Phase 5-6 — Itch.io Asset Pack + Package

| Deliverable               | Path                                        | Status                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Itch.io zip package       | `dist/foldwink-itch.zip`                    | ~110 KB, ready to upload                                |
| Upload guide              | `docs/ITCH_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`                 | Complete — settings, pricing, metadata                  |
| Page copy                 | `docs/ITCH_PAGE_COPY.md`                    | Complete — 200 puzzles, honest, accurate                |

### Phase 7-8 — Readiness + PWYW Gate

See Final Verdict Table below.

### Phase 9 — Docs Update

| Document                    | Update                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docs/TODO.md`              | Full rewrite — reflects 0.6.1, 200 puzzles, current blockers                                                                                           |

## 2. What Was NOT Done (Honestly)

| Item                             | Reason                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Human browser QA pass            | Requires a real person on a real device           |
| Sound ear verification           | Requires human listening in speakers + headphones |
| Share card visual verification   | Requires human eye judgment                       |
| Raster OG image (PNG)            | Human art task                                    |
| Designed wordmark/logotype       | Human art task                                    |
| Colour-blind accessibility audit | Requires specialized testing                      |
| Screen-reader QA                 | Requires assistive technology testing             |
| Actual itch.io draft upload      | Requires itch.io account access                   |
| Content expansion beyond 200     | Out of scope for this pass                        |
| Payment/monetization             | Intentionally deferred                            |

## 3. Bugs Found and Fixed

| Bug                                   | Severity | Root Cause                                                                     | Fix                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wink indicator shown on Hard mode     | HIGH     | `FoldwinkTabs` didn't check `puzzle.difficulty` when computing `winkAvailable` | Added `puzzle.difficulty === "medium"` guard; hid entire wink chip on non-medium puzzles |
| Onboarding button off-screen at 320px | HIGH     | Modal inner container had no overflow or max-height constraints                | Added `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto`                                         |

## 9. Handoff

### Done

- All code-doable UX blockers fixed
- Browser QA covers Easy/Medium/Hard on desktop + mobile
- Real bug found and fixed (Wink on Hard)
- Itch.io package ready to upload
- Store page copy ready
- Store screenshots captured
- All automated gates green
- Docs updated to reflect reality

### Not Done

- Human QA (browser, sound, share card, mobile)
- Raster assets (OG image, cover, icon PNGs)
- Itch.io draft upload
- Content expansion
- Monetization

### Next Recommended Action

Open `scripts/preview-sounds.html` and `scripts/preview-share-cards.html` in a real browser. Listen to the sounds, look at the cards. If they pass, run through `docs/ITCH_QA_CHECKLIST.md` on a phone and desktop. That's ~30 minutes of human work between current state and public free launch.

### Rerun Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript check
npm test                # 108 unit tests
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run validate        # Puzzle validator
npm run build           # Production build
node scripts/human-like-qa.mjs  # Browser QA (needs preview server)
node scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs  # Store screenshots (needs preview server)
```
