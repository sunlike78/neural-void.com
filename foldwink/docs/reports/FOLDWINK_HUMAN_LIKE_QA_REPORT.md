## 2. Test Setup

- **Server:** `npm run preview -- --host` serving `dist/` on port 4174
- **Stack:** Playwright 1.59.1 (chromium) running `scripts/human-like-qa.mjs`
- **Pacing:** 400 ms delays between actions (human-like)
- **Viewports:** 1280×800 (desktop), 375×812 (iPhone X mobile), 320×568 (iPhone SE narrow)
- **Limitations:** Headless Chromium — no real audio output, no real native share API, no visual-aesthetic judgment. Screenshots are captured but visual quality assessment remains human-only.

| Medium gameplay                 | not tested (locked — fresh state)               | —          | —                 |
| Hard gameplay                   | not tested (locked — fresh state)               | —          | —                 |
| Share flow                      | not triggered (no in-game share in easy result) | —          | —                 |

**Note:** Medium and Hard were not tested because the QA agent starts with a fresh localStorage (no prior stats), so both modes are correctly locked. This confirms the progression gating works. Testing Medium/Hard gameplay would require pre-seeding stats or playing through 5+ easy wins first.

## 4. Findings by Severity

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Onboarding "Got it" button off-screen at 320px viewport** | mobile-fit | The onboarding modal's "Got it" button is positioned below the visible area on 320×568 screens (iPhone SE). Users cannot dismiss onboarding without scrolling inside the modal — which may not be discoverable. | `14-narrow-menu.png` — captured after forced JS click |

| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3   | Daily button present                       | menu        | Visible on all viewports                                                |
| 4   | Easy button present                        | menu        | Visible on all viewports                                                |
| 5   | Medium button present (disabled=true)      | menu        | Correctly locked on fresh state                                         |
| 6   | Hard/Master button present (disabled=true) | menu        | Correctly locked/coming-soon on fresh state                             |

| 9   | Stats screen loaded                        | stats       | Renders with empty record state on first visit                          |
| 10  | After reload: grid restored                | persistence | Mid-game session persistence works — grid was present after page reload |
| 11  | No horizontal overflow on menu (375px)     | mobile-fit  | body = 375px exactly at iPhone X viewport                               |
| 12  | Card tap target: 80×53px                   | mobile-fit  | Min dimension 53px — above 44px recommended minimum. Adequate.          |

## 5. Desktop UX Assessment

Based on screenshots `01-desktop-load.png` through `09-desktop-after-reload.png`:

- **App load:** Clean dark theme, no flash of unstyled content, BrandMark + Wordmark visible.
- **Onboarding:** Modal appears on first visit with clear rules, Tabs demo, difficulty explanation. "Got it" dismisses cleanly.
- **Menu:** Clear button hierarchy — Daily prominent, Easy/Medium/Hard/Stats stacked. Readiness copy visible below buttons. "by Neural Void" sublabel present.
- **Game screen:** 4×4 grid renders with generous card spacing. Timer visible in header. Mistake dots present. Cards show clear selected state on click.
- **After submit:** Grid updates — either a group locks in (colour + shape marker) or mistake count advances.
- **Stats:** StatStrip + 2×2 grid + Depth section + Daily Archive all render. Empty state message shown when no history.
- **Persistence:** After reload mid-game, the game screen was restored with the grid visible — session persistence confirmed.
- **Overall desktop impression:** Layout is clean, hierarchy is readable, no visual breakage observed. **Confidence: high for structure, low for aesthetic quality (headless — no human eye).**

## 6. Mobile Fit Assessment

### iPhone X (375×812)

Based on screenshots `10-mobile-menu.png` through `13-mobile-stats.png`:

- **Menu:** Fits well. All buttons visible. Readiness copy readable. Footer with sound toggle and "About" present.
- **Game grid:** 4×4 grid fits within viewport. Card size 80×53px — adequate touch targets (53px min dimension > 44px recommended).
- **No horizontal overflow:** Confirmed — body width = viewport width.
- **Stats:** Renders cleanly. Daily archive visible.
- **Overall iPhone X:** **Fits well.** No critical issues.

### iPhone SE (320×568) — NARROW

Based on screenshots `14-narrow-menu.png` and `15-narrow-easy-game.png`:

- **Onboarding issue (HIGH):** The "Got it" button falls outside the 568px viewport height. The modal content (BrandMark + heading + demo grid + 4 rules + button) exceeds the available height. On a real 320×568 device, the user would need to scroll inside the modal — but the modal uses `fixed inset-0` positioning, which may not allow scrolling depending on overflow settings.
- **Menu after dismiss:** Fits after onboarding is dismissed. Buttons are readable but dense.
- **Game grid:** Grid fits at 320px width, but cards are small (~68×45px). Touch targets are borderline.
- **Overall narrow:** **Tight but functional after onboarding is dismissed.** The onboarding overflow is the main issue.

**Recommended fix:** Add `overflow-y: auto` to the onboarding modal inner container, or reduce the visual content (smaller demo grid) to ensure "Got it" is always reachable.

## 7. Progression / Difficulty Assessment

- **Easy surface:** Works correctly. 16 cards, submit, feedback — all functional.
- **Medium readiness:** Medium button correctly disabled on fresh state (0 wins). Copy reads "Medium — locked". Readiness signal shows "Warming up · A few easy solves first — Medium unlocks at 5 easy wins." Clear and non-patronizing.
- **Hard surface:** Master Challenge button disabled. Shows "Master Challenge — soon" or similar. Honest representation of scaffolded state with 20 real puzzles behind it.
- **Tabs / Wink:** Not directly tested in this run (Medium locked). Structural code review confirms Tabs render on Medium with progressive reveal, Wink button appears, and Hard uses half-speed reveal with no Wink.
- **Progression copy clarity:** Readable and well-structured. The nudge → unlock → recommendation ladder is present in the code. Not visually verified because the agent didn't play 5+ wins.

## 8. Sound / Motion Assessment

### Verified behaviors

- AudioContext creation is guarded behind user gesture (confirmed in code + iOS test from prior session)
- Sound mute toggle (`SoundToggle`) component exists and persists to localStorage
- All 9 cue call sites are wired in GameScreen and ResultScreen

### Not verifiable by this automation

- **Sound quality** — headless Chromium does not play audio. A human must open `scripts/preview-sounds.html` in a real browser.
- **Motion visual quality** — headless screenshots capture final state, not animation. Motion tokens exist in code (`fw-shake`, `fw-pop`, `fw-tab-reveal`), but their perceptual quality is human-only.
- **Sound after first gesture** — the iOS Safari resume fix is confirmed working from a prior manual test session.

### Confidence

- Sound event wiring: **high** (code-verified + iOS confirmed)
- Sound quality: **unverified** (human-only)
- Motion quality: **unverified** (human-only)

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Friend testing (desktop)**          | **Pass**                           | App loads, plays, persists, no errors. Onboarding works. Menu is clear.                           |
| **Friend testing (mobile iPhone X+)** | **Pass**                           | 375px+ fits well. Touch targets adequate.                                                         |
| **Friend testing (narrow 320px)**     | **Conditional Pass**               | Onboarding "Got it" off-screen — fixable with overflow:auto. Game itself works after dismiss.     |
| **Mobile fit overall**                | **Good at 375px+, tight at 320px** |                                                                                                   |
| **Public free test**                  | **Conditional Pass**               | Needs: screenshots for store page, sound ear check, share card visual check, narrow-viewport fix. |

## 12. Recommended Next Actions

1. **Fix onboarding overflow on 320px** — add `overflow-y: auto max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]` to the modal inner container. Quick fix, removes the only HIGH finding.
2. **Human sound ear pass** — open `scripts/preview-sounds.html` in a real browser, click each cue twice.
3. **Human share card visual pass** — open `scripts/preview-share-cards.html`, verify all 5 cards.
4. **Play 5 Easy + 1 Medium as a human** — verify Tabs + Wink + progression messaging works as expected.
5. **Capture screenshots for itch.io** from a real browser at 1280×800 for store page assets.
