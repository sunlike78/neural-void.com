# Foldwink Sprint R9 - Reviewed Content Backfill

Date: 2026-07-23

## Sprint Summary

- Restored the hard product invariant of exactly 500 active puzzles per language without returning retired low-trust boards.
- Added 10 new EN, 4 RU and 4 DE puzzles after structural validation and independent editorial review.
- Reworked all six initially held drafts before promotion; two original weak drafts were rebuilt rather than patched.
- Preserved retired records and unrelated draft work; no old puzzle identifier was reused for the promoted RU content.

## Changed Files

- Active additions: `puzzles/pool/puzzle-0505.json` through `puzzle-0514.json`.
- Active additions: `puzzles/ru/pool/ru-0501.json` through `ru-0504.json`.
- Active additions: `puzzles/de/pool/de-0501.json` through `de-0504.json`.
- `docs/reports/FOLDWINK_CONTENT_BACKFILL_EN_R3.md`, `FOLDWINK_CONTENT_BACKFILL_VALIDATION_R3.md`, `FOLDWINK_SPRINT_R9_CONTENT_BACKFILL.md`.
- `docs/TODO.md`.

## Tests Run

- `npm run validate` - passed, EN 500.
- `npm run validate:ru` - passed, RU 500.
- `npm run validate:de` - passed, DE 500.
- `npm run audit:logic` - passed; one pre-reviewed non-defect signal remains.
- Scoped structural audit of all 18 promoted drafts - passed: no active-ID collision, 16 unique cards each, no long cards, and valid medium hints.

## Manual QA Notes

- Independent R3 review initially accepted 12, held 4, and rejected 2 drafts. Each of the six findings was fixed, structurally rechecked, and manually accepted in the R3.1 addendum before promotion.
- New medium Tabs use distinguishing keywords; the existing 320px/390px long-label E2E guards the rendered tab surface.

## Open Risks

- Long-running content quality still depends on small, reviewed batches. The warning count is a queue, not a release blocker.
- Physical iPhone Safari and Android device checks remain required before public release.

## Go / No-Go

**GO** for final release-readiness work. The 500-per-language content invariant is restored with reviewed, non-reused content.
